[{"categories":null,"contents":"   About the Good Governance Initiative  The Good Governance Initiative is a set of best practices and guidelines to build and develop an Open Source Program Office (OSPO), published by the OSPO Alliance initiative.\nEverything we do happens in the open, on the GitLab page of the GGI. Our meetings are public, and you are welcome to join.\nFor the latest official version of the GGI Handbook, please see the OSPO.Zone website.\n\nThe major goals of the initiative are the following:\n A clear and practical path for improvement, with small, affordable steps to mitigate risks, educate people, adapt processes, communicate inwards and outwards the organisation\u0026rsquo;s realm. Guidance and a breadth of curated references about open-source licencing, practices, training, and ecosystems, to leverage open-source awareness and culture, consolidate internal knowledge and extend leadership. An easy-to-understand assessment program to identify pain points and evaluate the organisation\u0026rsquo;s current practices. A certifying process to help you select the right partners and show your commitment to the world.     Content  In the course of this program you will learn:\n How to properly and safely use open source software within the company to improve re-use, maintainability and velocity of development teams. About the legal and technical risks associated with external code and collaboration, and how to mitigate them. About the required training for teams, from developers to team leaders and managers, so everybody shares the same, unified vision. How to build up your own strategy, define goals and setup the required processes within the organisation, with real-world use cases and examples, from top experts of the domain. How to properly communicate within the company and to the external world so as to make the most of your strategy. How to improve competitiveness and attractiveness for your organisation through open-source usage and evangelism.     Activities  The framework uses activities to identify practices relevant to OSS Good Governance. Activities are organised into goals and provide a roadmap and guidance to define and develop an OSPO.\nThere is an online visualisation of the activities developed for the GGI Handbook v1.0, see the Level Board\n","date":"Jan 01","permalink":"https://gitlab.com/bbaldassari/my-ggi/roadmap/","tags":null,"title":"About The GGI"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Promote open source development best practices Link to activitiy in board: https://gitlab.ow2.org/ggi/my-ggi-board-test/-/issues/36\nThis activity is about defining, actively promoting and implementing open source best practices within the development teams.\nRun code reviews Link to activitiy in board: https://gitlab.ow2.org/ggi/my-ggi-board-test/-/issues/35\nCode review is a routine task involving manual and/or automated review of an application\u0026rsquo;s source code before releasing a product or delivering a project to the customer. In the case of open-source software, code review is more than just about catching errors opportunistically; it is an integrated approach to collaborative development carried out at the team level.\nInventory of open source skills and resources Link to activitiy in board: https://gitlab.ow2.org/ggi/my-ggi-board-test/-/issues/26\nAt any stage, from a management perspective, it is useful to have a mapping, an inventory of open source resources, assets, usage and their status, as well as potential needs and available solutions. It also includes assessing the required effort and skills to fill the gap.\n","date":"Jan 01","permalink":"https://gitlab.com/bbaldassari/my-ggi/past_activities/","tags":null,"title":"Completed activities"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Open source enabling digital transformation Link to activitiy in board: https://gitlab.ow2.org/ggi/my-ggi-board-test/-/issues/50\n \u0026ldquo;Digital Transformation is the adoption of digital technology to transform services or businesses, through replacing non-digital or manual processes with digital processes or replacing older digital technology with newer digital technology.\u0026rdquo; (Wikipedia)\n Open source enabling innovation Link to activitiy in board: https://gitlab.ow2.org/ggi/my-ggi-board-test/-/issues/49\n Innovation is the practical implementation of ideas that result in the introduction of new goods or services or improvement in offering goods or services.\nâ€” Schumpeter, Joseph A.\n Support open source communities Link to activitiy in board: https://gitlab.ow2.org/ggi/my-ggi-board-test/-/issues/42\nThis activity is about engaging with institutional representatives of the open source world.\nEngage with open source projects Link to activitiy in board: https://gitlab.ow2.org/ggi/my-ggi-board-test/-/issues/41\nThis activity is about committing significant contributions to some OSS projects that are important to you. Contributions are scaled up and committed at the organisation level (not personal level as in #26). They can take several forms, from direct funding to resources allocation (e.g. people, servers, infrastructure, communication, etc.), as long as they benefit the project or ecosystem sustainably and efficiently.\nContribute to open source projects Link to activitiy in board: https://gitlab.ow2.org/ggi/my-ggi-board-test/-/issues/37\nContributing to open source projects that are freely used is one of the key principles of good governance. The point is to avoid being a simple passive consumer and give back to the projects. When people add a feature or fix a bug for their own purpose, they should make it generic enough to contribute to the project. Developers must be allowed time for contributions.\nOpen source competency growth Link to activitiy in board: https://gitlab.ow2.org/ggi/my-ggi-board-test/-/issues/27\nThis activity is about planning and initiating technical abilities and early experience with OSS once an inventory has been conducted (#17). It is also the opportunity to start establishing a basic, lightweight skills development roadmap.\n Identify what the required skills and training are. Set up a pilot project to kick start the approach, learn from doing, establish a first achievement milestone. Capitalise on lessons learned and build a body of knowledge. Start identifying and documenting the next steps for broader adoption. Elaborate a strategy over the next few months or a year to engage management and financial support.
