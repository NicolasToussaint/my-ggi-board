[{"categories":null,"contents":"   About the Good Governance Initiative  The Good Governance Initiative is a set of best practices and guidelines to build and develop an Open Source Program Office (OSPO), published by the OSPO Alliance initiative.\nEverything we do happens in the open, on the GitLab page of the GGI. Our meetings are public, and you are welcome to join.\nFor the latest official version of the GGI Handbook, please see the OSPO.Zone website.\n\nThe major goals of the initiative are the following:\n A clear and practical path for improvement, with small, affordable steps to mitigate risks, educate people, adapt processes, communicate inwards and outwards the organisation\u0026rsquo;s realm. Guidance and a breadth of curated references about open-source licencing, practices, training, and ecosystems, to leverage open-source awareness and culture, consolidate internal knowledge and extend leadership. An easy-to-understand assessment program to identify pain points and evaluate the organisation\u0026rsquo;s current practices. A certifying process to help you select the right partners and show your commitment to the world.     Content  In the course of this program you will learn:\n How to properly and safely use open source software within the company to improve re-use, maintainability and velocity of development teams. About the legal and technical risks associated with external code and collaboration, and how to mitigate them. About the required training for teams, from developers to team leaders and managers, so everybody shares the same, unified vision. How to build up your own strategy, define goals and setup the required processes within the organisation, with real-world use cases and examples, from top experts of the domain. How to properly communicate within the company and to the external world so as to make the most of your strategy. How to improve competitiveness and attractiveness for your organisation through open-source usage and evangelism.     Activities  The framework uses activities to identify practices relevant to OSS Good Governance. Activities are organised into goals and provide a roadmap and guidance to define and develop an OSPO.\nThere is an online visualisation of the activities developed for the GGI Handbook v1.0, see the Level Board\n","date":"Jan 01","permalink":"/roadmap/","tags":null,"title":"About The GGI"},{"categories":null,"contents":"   General progress  \n data = { labels: [ 'Done', 'Working', 'Roadmap' ], datasets: [{ label: 'My activities', data: [7, 3, 15], backgroundColor: [ 'rgb(255, 99, 132)', 'rgb(54, 162, 235)', 'rgb(255, 205, 86)' ], hoverOffset: 4 }] }; new Chart(\"allActivities\", { type: \"doughnut\", data: data });     Goals  \n labels = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g']; data = { labels: labels, datasets: [{ label: 'My First Dataset', data: [65, 59, 80, 81, 56, 55, 40], backgroundColor: [ 'rgba(255, 99, 132, 0.2)', 'rgba(255, 159, 64, 0.2)', 'rgba(255, 205, 86, 0.2)', 'rgba(75, 192, 192, 0.2)', 'rgba(54, 162, 235, 0.2)', 'rgba(153, 102, 255, 0.2)', 'rgba(201, 203, 207, 0.2)' ], borderColor: [ 'rgb(255, 99, 132)', 'rgb(255, 159, 64)', 'rgb(255, 205, 86)', 'rgb(75, 192, 192)', 'rgb(54, 162, 235)', 'rgb(153, 102, 255)', 'rgb(201, 203, 207)' ], borderWidth: 1 }] }; new Chart(\"myGoals\", { type: 'bar', data: data, options: { scales: { y: {beginAtZero: true} } }});     Your dashboard - radar  \n const data = { labels: [ 'Usage Goal', 'Trust Goal', 'Culture Goal', 'Engagement Goal', 'Strategy Goal' ], datasets: [{ label: 'My First Dataset', data: [5, 4, 2, 2, 1], fill: true, backgroundColor: 'rgba(255, 99, 132, 0.2)', borderColor: 'rgb(255, 99, 132)', pointBackgroundColor: 'rgb(255, 99, 132)', pointBorderColor: '#fff', pointHoverBackgroundColor: '#fff', pointHoverBorderColor: 'rgb(255, 99, 132)' }] }; new Chart(\"myChart\", { type: \"radar\", data: data, options: { elements: { line: { borderWidth: 3 } }, scales: { r: { suggestedMin: 0, suggestedMax: 5 } } }, });  ","date":"Jan 01","permalink":"/dashboard/","tags":null,"title":"My Dashboard"}]
