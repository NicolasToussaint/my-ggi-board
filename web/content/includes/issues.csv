> ""Digital Transformation is the adoption of digital technology to transform services or businesses, through replacing non-digital or manual processes with digital processes or replacing older digital technology with newer digital technology."" (Wikipedia)

When the most advanced organisations in Digital Transformation jointly drive change through their Business, IT and Finance to anchor digital in the way, they reconsider:
- Business model: value chain with ecosystems, as a service, SaaS.
- Finance: opex/capex, people, outsourcing.
- IT: innovation, legacy/asset modernization.

Open source is at the heart of digital transformation:
- Technologies, Agile practices, product management.
- People: collaboration, open communication, development/decision cycle.
- Business models: try & buy, open innovation.

In terms of competitiveness, the most visible processes are probably the processes that directly impact the customer experience.  And we have to recognize that the big players, as well as start-up companies, by delivering totally unprecedented customer experience, drastically changed customer expectations. 

Customer experience as well as all the other processes within a company entirely depend on IT.  Every company has to transform its IT, this is what the digital transformation is about.  Companies that have not done it yet, have now to achieve their digital transformation as fast as possible, otherwise the risk is that they could be wiped out of the market.  Digital Transformation is a condition for survival.  Since the stakes are so high, a company cannot entirely leave the digital transformation to a supplier.  Every company has to get hands on with its IT, which means that every company has to get hands on with open source software because there is no IT without open source software.

Expected benefits of the digital transformation include: 
* Simplify, automate core processes, make them real-time.
* Enable fast responses to competitive changes.
* Take advantage of Artificial intelligence and big data.### Opportunity Assessment

Digital transformation could be managed by:
* Segments of the IT: Production IT, Business Support IT (CRM, billing, procurementâ€¦), Support IT (HR, Finance, accounting...), Big Data.
* Type of technology or process supporting the IT: Infrastructure (cloud), Artificial Intelligence, Processes (Make-or-Buy, DevSecOps, SaaS).

Injecting open source in a particular segment or technology of your IT reveals that you want to get hands on in this segment or technology, because you assessed that this particular segment or technology of your IT is important for the competitiveness of your company.
It is important to assess the position of your company compared not only with your competitors, but also with other industries, and key players in terms of customer experience and market solutions.### Progress Assessment

1. Level 1: Situation assessment
* I have identified:
  - the segments of IT that are important for the competitiveness of my company, and 
  - the open source technologies required to develop applications in these segments.   
And I have thus decided:
  - on which segments I want to manage in-house the development of projects, and
  - on which open source technologies I need to build in-house expertise.

2. Level 2: Engagement
* On some selected open source technologies used within the company, several developers have been trained and are recognized as valuable contributors by the open source community.
In some selected segments, projects based upon open source technologies have been launched.

3. Level 3: Generalisation
* For all projects, an open source alternative is systematically being investigated during the inception stage of the project.  To make it easier for the project team to study such open source alternative, a central budget, and a central team of architects, hosted in the IT Department, is dedicated to providing assistance to the projects.  

**KPIs**:
* KPI 1. Ratio for which an open source alternative was investigated: (Number of projects / Total number of projects).
* KPI 2. Ratio for which the open source alternative was chosen: (Number of projects / Total number of projects).

Open source can be a key factor for innovation through diversity, collaboration and a fluent exchange of ideas. People from different backgrounds and domains may have different perspectives and provide new, improved or even disruptive answers to known problems. One can enable innovation by listening to different views and actively promoting open collaboration on projects and topics.

Similarly, participating in the elaboration and implementation of open standards is a great promoter of good practices and ideas to improve the company's daily work. It also allows the entity to drive and influence innovation to where and what it needs, and enhances its global visibility and reputation.

Through innovation, open source makes it possible not only to transform the goods or services that your company markets, but also to create or modify the whole ecosystem in which your company wants to thrive.  

As an example, by releasing Android as open source, Google is inviting hundreds of thousands of companies to build up their own services based upon this open source technology. Google is thus creating a whole ecosystem from which all participants could benefit. Of course, very few companies are powerful enough to create an ecosystem by their own decision. But there are many examples of alliances between companies to create such an ecosystem.
