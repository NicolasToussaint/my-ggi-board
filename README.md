# Introduction

This project helps implementing the [Good Governance Initiative (GGI)](https://ospo.zone/ggi) framework.  
The GGI framework is a guide to effectively implement, step by step, an Open Source Program Office in your organisation. It proposes 25 activities organised in 5 distinct goals.


The goal here is, within minutes, to set up a simple environment to:
- Select the Activities you want to focus on
- Describe _how_ it applies to your situation
- Set a list of objectives for each Activity
- Track your progress via a simple web page (hosted within GitLab pages)
- Organise tasks with your team
- Easily share your progress

# How it works

Everything can we put in place from the GitLab web interface, in 3 steps:
1. Fork this repository in your GitLab ([gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com) or your own instance)
2. Create an Access Token and configure a new CI/CD Variable in GitLab
3. Execute a pre-configured pipeline manually, only once.

This is what you get:
- An Issue per GGI Activity
- For each Activity, a section to detail your action plans and progres
- An Issue Board to organise your work
- A static Dashboard that report your current activity and progress, refreshed overnight by a scheduled pipeline.

To find out of to deploy the My-GGI-Board, see [getting-started.md](docs/getting-started.md)
