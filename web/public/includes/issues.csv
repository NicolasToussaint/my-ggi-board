Such commitment cannot happen if higher-level executives and top management are not themselves a part of it. The training and open source mindset must also be extended to those who shape the policies, decisions and overall strategy, both inside and outside the company.",5,0

Contributions are scaled up and committed at the organisation level (not personal level as in #26). They can take several forms, from direct funding to resources allocation (e.g. people, servers, infrastructure, communication, etc.), as long as they benefit the project or ecosystem sustainably and efficiently.

* **New processes and contracts**: Contracts have to be adapted to allow and promote external contributions. This includes IP and licensing issues for work done within the company, but also the ability for the employee or contractor to have their own projects. 
* **Different types of people**: People working with open source often have different incentives and mindsets than with pure proprietary, corporate people. Processes and mindsets need to adapt to this community reputation-oriented paradigm, in order to attract new types of talent and retain them along.
* **Career development**: need to offer a career path that nurtures and values employees for their technical and soft skills as well as the competencies expected by your organisation (collaboration to drive community efforts, communication to act as spokesperson for your company, etc.). By all means, HR has a key role in enabling open source as a cultural goal.",5,0

As with every community, people and entities have to participate and contribute back to the whole.

The point is to avoid being a simple passive consumer and give back to the projects. When people add a feature or fix a bug for their own purpose, they should make it generic enough to contribute to the project. Developers must be allowed time for contributions. ",3,0

- Identify what the required skills and training are.
- Set up a pilot project to kick start the approach, learn from doing, establish a first achievement milestone.
